Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is your first post.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.

## Getting Started

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## Writing Posts

Jekyll uses Markdown for writing posts. Here are some examples:

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Links and Images

You can add [links](https://jekyllrb.com) and images easily in Markdown.

### Emphasis

You can use *italic* and **bold** text.

## Next Steps

1. Customize the `_config.yml` file
2. Modify the layout templates in `_layouts/`
3. Write more posts in `_posts/`
4. Push to GitHub and your site will be live!

Happy blogging!
