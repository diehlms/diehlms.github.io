    <p>A bit more of a nightmare. It was nighttime and I was hanging with some a handful of others outside the back of the kitchen in Iron City. I had a club or weapon of some kind in my hand and was sort of pacing. I wasn’t nervous, but the mood had a celebatory flavor so it was hard to settle. People were milling about, laughing and goofing off. I looked around and noticed most people, still only a handful at this time, had similar handheld weapons.</p>

<p>Suddenly I got nervous with an impending sense of doom. Something was about to go horribly wrong. The other people around me were beginning to queue up and I shuffled my way in line. After a minute I removed myself and started towards the back, walking around the front of the dining hall until I saw more and more people streaming in from the beach and front lawn, all equiped with makeshift bats, clubs, instruments of damage.</p>

<p>I was almost near the rear of the line before I find the silhouette of the Rhino cast onto the white plaster wall. A cheer rippled through the line and the crowds mood ascended into restless excitment as quickly as mine sank to dread. The rhino was picking people from the line one by one and mauling them into shreds. It didn’t seem to damper the jubliation at all. The clubs were there for the group assault on the rhino but the odds were always stacked against us. Others with grins on their face continued to laugh and play until it was their turn with the beast.</p>

<p>I left the crowd behind and walked along the boardwalk, then hopped off to meander around the rocky shore. A native man I didnt recongnize was smoking on a precipice as the water lapped at his feet. I approached and began making conversation; he wondered why I wasnt with the others. We could still hear them across the water; the night was still and the bay carries sound as if there is no distance.</p>

<p>I said I felt uncomfortable, I guess I wasnt ready to die. He remarked about the ignorance of our clan. I dont know if he was grouping me in with them as well, but I don’t know why he’d exclude me.</p>
