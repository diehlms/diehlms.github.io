# About Me

Welcome to my blog! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights.

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's designed to be simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

## How it Works

- Write posts in Markdown in the `_posts` directory
- Push to the main branch
- GitHub automatically builds and deploys the site

Feel free to explore and enjoy reading!
