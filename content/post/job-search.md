<p>Well folks, the job search has begun in earnest over the past few weeks. After I got back from Canada in early August, I promised myself I'd get back on the horse and hit the job sites. So far a few nibbles from geology recruiters, but I've yet to hear back from anyone in the tech world.</p>
<p>I imagine it's tough to take chances on self-taught developers with such a huge pool of CS grads and Bootcamp grads running around, but developing has actually been a pretty rewarding experience regardless. There is so much to learn it honestly feels insane sometimes trying to grasp any section of it, but learning as much as I have in the past six months has given me enough confidence to pursue it. I'll try to not ramble on here, but I am excited about the future but I'm sure I will hit some serious roadblocks in the months ahead.</p>
