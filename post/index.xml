      <description>Well folks, the job search has begun in earnest over the past few weeks. After I got back from Canada in early August, I promised myself I&#39;d get back on the horse and hit the job sites. So far a few nibbles from geology recruiters, but I&#39;ve yet to hear back from anyone in the tech world.
I imagine it&#39;s tough to take chances on self-taught developers with such a huge pool of CS grads and Bootcamp grads running around, but developing has actually been a pretty rewarding experience regardless.</description>

      <description>Howdy. This is my personal blog. Obviously, there is not a surplus of content here, so come back later when I think of something to say if and when that happens. Otherwise, checkout my other projects or find my code on my Github link above.</description>
